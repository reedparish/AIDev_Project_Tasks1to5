The goal of this project was to analyze a dataset of AI-generated pull requests to understand what kinds of tasks agentic AI tools
perform, especially in relation to security. I began by creating a GitHub repository to organize my code and outputs and then
downloaded the dataset from HuggingFace. The project was completed in five structured steps, each producing a CSV file based on
a different table in the dataset.

In Tasks 1–4, I extracted and cleaned information from four main tables: pull request metadata, repository details, task types,
and commit-level data. Each task involved selecting the required fields, renaming them according to the assignment, and saving
the results as separate CSV files. Task 4 also included cleaning the diff data to remove special characters that could cause
encoding problems. These tasks helped break the dataset into manageable, well-structured components.

Task 5 combined the outputs from the earlier tasks to produce a final summary CSV. This file included the pull request ID, the
agent that created it, the task type, and its confidence score. I also added a SECURITY column, which flags whether a pull
request might be security-related by scanning its title and body for specific keywords. This automated step provided a quick
way to identify which PRs could involve security issues without manual inspection.

Overall, this project provided practice in data extraction, cleaning, merging, and classification. By organizing everything
through both Python scripts and GitHub, I created a clear workflow that transformed raw dataset tables into meaningful CSV files.
Completing Tasks 1–5 gave me a better understanding of how agentic AI tools operate within software development and how their
pull requests can be analyzed for potential security relevance.
